# Website for pianist

This is website which I designed and made for my brother-in-law, but it is still not in use, because I want
to rewrite it in my beloved Angular <3 and maybe improve its apperance a bit. In this project I wanted to
focus on webpack, scss and pure javascript. I wanted to have a website which is written without any
frameworks and library. Website is responsive and written according to the mobile first standards.
